# Number Scanner
This repository is to demonstrate the use of a parser used to process 9 digit numeric sequences. 
Each number is represented as 3 lines with 27 characters in each line. 

I could have used Lombok libraries to simplify use of Spring but decided against it to minimise 
risk of build issues in an IDE.


## Usage
java -jar NumberScannerApplication-0.0.1.jar <path-to-file-to-scan>

Output will be written to console
